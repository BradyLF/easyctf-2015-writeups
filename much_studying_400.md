## Problem

I suck at AP Lit (what is engwrish). I was able to steal the grader for the AP Lit test from the CollageBored, but it's not helping me do any better. Can you help me?

Source can be found [here](files/aplit.c), and the binary with the actual flag is on the shell server at `/problems/aplit`.
