EasyCTF 2015
======

Thanks for playing EasyCTF! We hope you really enjoyed the contest, despite several server issues that we were having. The solutions to the problems are in this book. If you would like to contribute, a Github repo will be up soon.

Make sure you read through all the writeups and understand how to do them! The writeups are one of the most important parts of the CTF because you could learn new things from every problem, whether you know it or not!

Contributing
------

We really appreciate all the hard work you guys put into solving these problems, so if you spent your time writing a writeup, we'd like to feature it here! But since these writeups will be provided to and read by everyone, we'd like to keep the writeups as orderly as possible.

We ask that you first submit your writeup as an *external writeup* (similar to the Github [CTFs](http://github.com/ctfs) repo), a link at the bottom of the page to your website, or paste, or gist. There's no required format for your writeup. This is also an excellent way to gain recognition for your CTF team!

We'll review the writeups provided and put the best ones or a mashup of the best ones into the actual page of the book. Don't worry, your writeups will still be listed after we post official solutions!
