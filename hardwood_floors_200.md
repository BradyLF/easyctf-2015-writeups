# Hardwood Floors (200)

## Problem

Our intelligence tells us that [this](files/hardwood.py) function was used to encrypt a message. They also managed to capture a spy while in the field. Unfortunately, our interrogators only managed to find the [ciphertext](files/floors.txt) of a message on his phone. Can you help us recover the secret message?

## Hint

The correct flag is the one you think is correct
