# ADoughBee (500)

## Problem

ADoughBee Incorporated has released their [FlagEncrypt](files/adoughbee.rar) software. But it seems that unless you unlock the software, you can't really do anything! I know that `evil@anomat.cf` has a working license, try to find their serial number!

The serial is 25 characters long, alphanumeric. When you submit the flag, don't include `easyctf{}`.
