# Sort-of Easy (50)

## Problem

Use the programming interface to complete this task.

Input: A list of numbers, separated by commas. Ex: `3,28,9,17,5`

Output: The list sorted from largest to smallest, separated by commas. Ex: `28,17,9,5,3`

Read the input from a file called&nbsp;`sorting-job.in`&nbsp;that&#39;s in the current working directory, and then write your output to a file called&nbsp;`sorting-job.out`.

## Hint

I wonder if there is a handy sort function for this?
