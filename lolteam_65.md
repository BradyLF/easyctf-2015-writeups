## Problem

There's a suspicious team out there called **lolteam**, I got my eyes on them for a while and I managed to <a href='/static/problems/lolteam/lolteam.pcapng' target='_blank'>wiretap</a> their browser as they were changing their password. What did they change their password to? [apple](files/apple.jpg). Nothing to see here!

## Hint

Apples are suspicious. Don't trust apples. They always have something to hide . . .
